# EE333-Project2

This project contains the PCB design and software neccesary to run a custom made BLDC and servo controller. The controller also interfaces with an LCD and communicates to a python app run on a PC over Bluetooth using the BLE interface. It was created for the EE333 PCB design course at Iowa State.

The controller uses the Atmega 2560 chip for all purposes. The BLDC controller was inspired by a blog post (https://simple-circuit.com/arduino-sensorless-bldc-motor-controller-esc/) and converted from being for the Atmega 328 to the 2560. The bluetooth utilizes the AT05 breakout board.
